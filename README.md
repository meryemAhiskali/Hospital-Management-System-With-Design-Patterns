# Hospital Management System With Design Patterns
Meryem Ahıskalı - Nalan Gelir


This project is designed to develop a  management system. The main goal of our project is to make the system more effective and manageable by using design patterns.

The design patterns used are as follows:

1. Singleton Pattern
The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance is created throughout the application and provides a global access point to that instance. In our project, we used the Singleton pattern to optimize resource usage and ensure consistency by creating only one instance of certain classes.

2. Command Pattern
The Command pattern involves encapsulating commands as objects to enable their abstraction. In our project, we used the Command pattern to represent specific operations as objects, reducing dependencies between classes that invoke these operations. This increased the system's flexibility and reusability.

3. Decorator Pattern
The Decorator pattern is used to dynamically change the behavior of objects. In our project, we utilized the Decorator pattern to modify the behavior of certain objects at runtime, thus facilitating the system's extensibility and maintenance.

4. Observer Pattern
The Observer pattern establishes a dependency between objects, allowing automatic updating of other objects when a change occurs in one object's state. In our project, we employed the Observer pattern to monitor specific states and update other objects accordingly.
